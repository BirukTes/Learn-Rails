 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, or any plugin's
 * vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS/SCSS
 * files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
 * It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.

// the *= require_self directive indicates that any CSS in the file should be delivered to the
// browser. The *= require_tree . directive (note the Unix “dot operator”) indicates any files in
// the same folder, including files in subfolders, should be combined into a single file for
// delivery to the browser.

// If your website is large and complex, you can remove the *= require_tree . directive and
// specify individual files to be included in the file that is generated by the asset pipeline. This
// gives you the option of reducing the size of the application-wide CSS file that is delivered to
// the browser. For example, you might segregate a file that includes CSS that is used only in
// the site’s administrative section. In general, only large and complex sites need this
// optimization. The speed of rendering a single large CSS file is faster than fetching multiple
// files.
