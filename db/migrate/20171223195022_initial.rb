class Initial < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  #  Rails 3.1 makes migrations smarter by providing a new change method. This method is preferred for writing
  #  constructive migrations (adding columns or tables).
  #  The migration knows how to migrate your database and reverse it when the migration is rolled
  #  back without the need to write a separate down method.
  def change
    create_table :visitors do |t|
      t.string :email
      t.text :content

      t.timestamps
    end
  end

  # A migration is a subclass of ActiveRecord::Migration that implements two methods: up (perform the required transformations) and down (revert them).

  # create_table
  # drop_table
  # remove_column
  # remove_index
  # rename_column
