 # Many websites include a robots.txt file for nosy bots so itâ€™s only fair that you offer a
 # humans.txt file for nosy people. Few people will look for it but you can add a file public/
 # humans.txt to credit and identify the creators and software behind the website. The HTML5
 # Boilerplate project offers an example file or you can borrow from RailsApps.
